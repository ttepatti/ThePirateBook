# The PirateBook

The PirateBook was a project started at a programming competition back in May, 2015.

The point of the project is to provide free storage for files using Facebook's Messenger chat, since Facebook has massive amounts of storage and files are never deleted.

We attempt to store files by encoding them in Base64 and then messaging them to ourselves, utilizing start and end tokens in order to know the length of the file and the file name.
